# Sprive Amulet

This project contains python code to power a wearable device with machine learning that can help track a person's carbon emissions. 
With the appropriate commands a user can record their emitting activites, find the emissions of a given activity, find the sum 
of their emissions since a given time period, and make goals to stop certain emission-causing activites. 

### Made using the OpenAI API.

### Note: All the responses generated by this code are NOT proven, and they are false. All emissions calculations are just random numbers. This is simply is code powered by an idea and NOT by data. 

## Example Responses:

Question: What are my current emissions?
