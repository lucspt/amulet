# Sprive Amulet

This project contains python code that I used to power a wearable Raspberry Pi device that can help a person to track and reduce their carbon footprint and emissions. 
With the appropriate commands a user can record their emitting activites, find the emissions of a given activity, find the sum 
of their emissions since a given time period, and make goals to stop certain emission-causing activites. 

Made using the OpenAI API.

## Example Responses:

Question: What are my current emissions?
